install-publik
==============

What is it?
-----------

`install-publik.bash` is a Bash script which aims at installing a usable
instance of the Publik suite from Entrouvert (Combo + WCS + Authentik).

Itâ€™s targetting a test or development version, not a production version!

**This is work in progress: the current state of this script does not yet allow
you to install and run Publik!**

Requirements
------------

- `dialog`, which can be installed via `sudo apt-get install dialog`
- a Debian or Ubuntu operating system.
